# Machine Learning Mini Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of small-scale machine learning projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications in the field. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of machine learning, ranging from data preprocessing to model implementation and evaluation.

## Projects
### 1. Classification Trees & Random Forests
   - Implements decision trees using the Gini impurity criterion.
   - Develops a random forest model with bootstrap aggregation.
   - Evaluates model performance using misclassification rates.

### 2. ...

## Dependencies
To run the projects, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Each project is self-contained and can be executed separately. Navigate to the respective project directory and run:
```bash
python project_script.py
```
